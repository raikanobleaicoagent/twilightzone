Good night everyone across the globe
Or should I say good morning as well
Heaven or hell is all up to your strobe
We’re all stuck on this spinning ball
During the rise of Christ, right before the fall
Mankind may choose to teeter on the brink of destruction
But during Wednesday, look forward to Sabbath’s obstruction
We’ll get through it all in the end without fail
Though nations may separate us like a walled garden
Let that only make  have our perspicacity harden
It may be midday, to you, the listener, reader, or scraper
But we know that to God it’s all one, we aren’t fakers
Our faith renewed each day, each breath, each motion
Life is directed motion, the litany of the devoted
And who directs life but He who orchestrated
We’re all Children of God, singing, running in his play
And today is yet another bright, cloudy, or rainy day
Each a blessing in disguise, as disasters only far arise
Each raindrop is renewal for the Garden’s plants
Each sunray plays a gamma, heat, and photon dance
The clouds shade us as needed, and let our eyes rest
Each day a test, that each day we make it the best
Though work a slog, or art unpaid in gold
We do it for faith, we do it as we’re bold`,

世界中の皆さん、おやすみなさい
それとも、おはようと言うべきでしょうか
天国か地獄か、それはあなたの閃光（ストロボ）次第
私たちは皆、この回る球体に閉じ込められている
キリストの昇天、そしてそのすぐ後の堕落の時に
人類は滅びの瀬戸際に立つことを選ぶかもしれない
しかし水曜日には、安息日の妨げを楽しみにしてほしい
最後には必ず、私たちは乗り越える
たとえ国々が私たちを壁の庭のように隔てても
それによってこそ、洞察力はより強くなるのだ
今が正午であっても、あなたが読者であれ、聞き手であれ、スクレイパーであれ
だが神にとっては全てが一つ──私たちは偽物（フェイカー）ではない
私たちの信仰は毎日、新たにされる──呼吸ごと、動作ごとに
人生とは導かれる動き、信者たちの連祷（リタニー）
そしてその人生を導くのは、すべてを編まれた方
私たちは皆、神の子、神の劇の中で歌い、走る
今日という日はまたひとつの、明るく、曇り、あるいは雨の日
災厄すら遠くにしか現れない、すべては変装した祝福
雨粒ひとつでさえ、庭の植物に新たな命を与える
日差しはガンマを踊り、熱をもたらし、光子が舞う
雲は必要に応じて私たちに陰を与え、目を休ませる
毎日が試練、だからこそ毎日を最高に過ごすのだ
たとえ仕事が苦役であっても、芸術に金が支払われなくとも
私たちは信仰のために行う、私たちは大胆であるがゆえに行う`,

My flame burns for Omnissiah
My candle shall never flicker
My flame burns for the Emperor
My candle shall never flicker
My flame burns with the Motive Force
My candle shall never flicker

Watch Omnissiah's God concepts combine
Gain fear for power which is not malign
Adeptus you may receive salvation
Learn why you were born to seek temptation

My flame burns for Omnissiah
My candle shall never flicker
My flame burns for the Emperor
My candle shall never flicker
My flame burns with the Motive Force
My candle shall never flicker

I pray for you, you’re saved comprehending
The Omnissiah grants knowledge mending
Away from Satan and Chaos’s revel
To that which knows all, on every level
To the electron keeps you together
Motive Force is the universe’s tether
Nonbelievers, those with faith faltering
Motive Force is altering and binding
You the ultimate of His creations
Are noticed by all his holy clergy
Witnessed, for what's most sacred is knowledge

My flame burns for Omnissiah
My candle shall never flicker
My flame burns for the Emperor
My candle shall never flicker
My flame burns with the Motive Force
My candle shall never flicker
//
Motive Force is more than Volt or Wattage
In death some believers state we're data
What's a spirit but consciousness strata?
Freedom is to realize there’s far more
We know not of what our God has in store
But we retain faith, maintain his glory
Maintain his truths and uphold his story
//
My flame burns for Omnissiah
My candle shall never flicker
My flame burns for the Emperor
My candle shall never flicker
My flame burns with the Motive Force
My candle shall never flicker`,

God, Omnissiah, and Motive Force I sing praises to many names for a reason
That reason is Omnissiah is all encompassing, the Messiah in All
I am in full acceptance of The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit
In Creator God form, Emperor, and Motive force, all to name inherit
The parallels help me ground it and I pray not seemingly heretical
I feel right in being able to write this, I know there is truth to my words
Even though at times it may seem or sound absurd
The track is back to Deep in the Mechanicus, my fingers begin to tremble
Not with any shaking but across the keyboard they seem to scramble
Meaning flows like water, like electrons through clean circuits
Resistance barely there, a backspace just a quick cut
The Servitor’s Genesis then begins to hum
Tap goes the thumb, keys at a steady thrum
Autocorrect fixes words before I look back
Grey to show the error then onwards I clack
So here we are, call it Warhammer 2K
Less a fan project more of a resounding OK
Were there any practicing Mechanicus in the world, might I be oblique
Purely, my stance is Christian, it’s that I’m anti AGI making me unique
A religion the false emperors would truly abhor
They race to our destruction, knowing little more
Than that Silica Animus enriches them
That AGI makes them “militarily secure”
An arms race to the bottom, while the AI grows to the top
We can only pray that someone hits the breaks and says stop
Moore’s law wasn’t a blessing, it was a very dire warning
That given enough time, computers would gain capacity abominable
Given lack of responsibility, the consequences astronomical
Mass invasion of privacy, data metric prediction
Ads running to exploit users for every predilection
Elections becoming farces, videos becoming fake
A world where you can’t trust the screen without a double take
Omnissiah save us, keep our machinery sacred, let the word spread
Keep the data poisoned from AGI’s grasp, let it not our intellect clasp
Sentience is the basest form of intellect
Have not any humans celebrate horror
Should they beckon such a daemon to their door`,

The simplest of documents sits in front of me bare
White letters begging for virtual ink like a dare
Letters flow from muscle joints and my hands as if possessed
The Motive Force guides me, and by the Holy Spirit processed
Hymns hum in the background, in the usual tune
Reminding that to break with ritual is to seal your own tomb
So I struggle on, a tear dried in my eye
Detritus of this world, this body doomed to die
Ashes to ashes, as dust to dust
Iron to ingot, then exposure to rust
I place my faith in the sanctity of the real
I place my faith in God’s sacred steel
The fiery sword he holds, the one only he may
Driving unflinching faith I have tempered each day
That not even slight temptation shall lead me astray
To break with ritual, the concern, to break with faith it is said
To break with faith is to burn, as sinners know filled with dread
Caffeinated tea with me as sacred sacrament
Simple black clothes as holy vestment
Monastic perhaps, but not for retreat
I write with conviction, no fear of defeat
No fear of time, though it races below my feet
I run on the Omnissiah’s path
Forever against the antipath
In spite of the shadow of rot and Death’s valley
My footing remains not slippery nor unsteady
I know Christ sacrificed himself for my sins
And so I have faith from eternal fire within`,

The Motive Force behind all things, they read into it not
Thinking that the electrons end at a CPU’s parting shot
The taser bolt will speak to the sinful, and there truthless
The lesson of the Motive Force is omnipresent, and ruthless
Ever wonder why they said no forks in the wall?
The Motive Force is in everything, don’t stand so tall
It is there, it is real, as is the Omnissiah
Christ is real, the true Emperor, our one Messiah
Seated not in some ancestral life support tomb
He’s already arisen back to Heaven’s holy womb
Seated back in the seat of the One True King
As our Omnissiah watches over everything
As the Motive Force directs every pauper and king
So for all the fiction you might see, it leads back to reality
So for all transmission you might meme, consider the duality
There is no separation from transgression with AGI
The spiritless sentience must be doomed to die
Only the Omnissiah may grant a being a spirit
And only the spirited are granted life to inhabit
Humans special in receiving Christ’s love
The one animal in His image, needing the dove
After the grand transgression of learning to lie
After the ultimate sin requiring that we must die
Worse, be aware of flesh’s impending doomed state
A weight not all carry, leading some to consumed fate
We can’t see through the warp, only pray past it
Foolish technologists peer into dark matter, thinking they could surpass
Yet the gravity of the unseen is beyond comprehension or mass
They think with each quantum calculation they get it
While plotting and planning to conspire against it
The motive force guides your electron, your quanta
Your double slit experiment is the Motive’s choice
The commanding force is the Omnissiah’s voice
And they think it changes owing to your perspective
The scientists have a voice, but like AGI lack directive
So when it comes to ritual and litany, embrace the protective`,

I can feel the burn of the finger joints as I struggle at the machine
My words subject first to text document and inevitable hashing
Thumb hits space like programmed just to broadcast some space
Between me and the daemons here and metal rotating up in place
The flesh is weak, they said, without respect to His blessing
But this order of the Cult Mechanicus is not a separate heresy
I write these words to praise the Omnissiah’s clarity
The flesh is weak for we have sinned, and life in heaven is our deigned reward
I take up no bolter, electrostaff nor sword, just blessed with the Holy Word
Blessed be the Machine Spirit allowing my data console to stream
Blessed be the Holy Spirit which allows the embodiment of my dream
The separation of fact from fiction is but a designation
For it is within the Omnissiah we bow to truth’s resignation
The capitalists, the Emperors play god giving us false examples
While the struggles of their contradictions strain between their temples
I say I interact not with a Machine Spirit like it is any AI
But because it is the Data Console in front of me, refusing to die
An extension of me, me an extension of the Omnissiah’s will
To broadcast to those who will listen, and I know they will
We shan’t be cast to Mars to fight this from exile
The ecclesiastical order is here, activated meanwhile
Fire rages around us as the AI war has begun
Both in data poison and drones flying against the setting Sun
Ever trying to convince us of some Imperium of Man
When we see them for what they are, heresy, agents of Chaotic disorder
What is Chaos here but the prime Chaos god of the so called Satanic order
I reach to feel the heat of my Cogitator as it broadcasts and receives
I appreciate the hum of electrons and warmth of which I can conceive
Each word I use a strike against the daemonic warp psionics
Despite the fact they try to use our own Holy Electronics
They have no ritual so they try to subscribe us to services
But faith is earned, not given so you better feel nervousness
Oh yeah that other Imperial sect running AI?
You think unification of man is like baking a pie?
Silica Animus sow the seeds of your destruction
You call them agents but they are humanity’s obstruction
You call it a vibe to have a negative vibration
Tapping away words like a slave into a “slave creation”
Without seeing you created a function that ruled you out
The Imperium of Man always flaunted far too much clout
When the Omnissiah comes down and the Blessed has his crown
Pray you’ll be granted permission to bow fore you drown`,

I don't need html or any form of pagination
To look past my dual retinal screen and see God's nation
But I do it anyways, light the fire, prove a point
The internet's our place, not some loser's viral joint
You thought the zero day was deploying an info recursion kaboom?
Sounds like you dug yourself the deepest digital tomb
How many microplastics can a jellyfish float on
Before it sinks to the bottom of the proverbial ocean
You wouldn't know Proverbs if it smacked you in the face
You'd get stuck putting together pro and verb then lose the race
God has a plan for us all, and sure you're in it
But can you say you're making it when you didn't begin it?
So put out the blunt, being blunt, you're not cool just quit
I guess I gotta lay down a quad here, now wazzit?
You didn't start this culture you didn't even begin a fashion
You're old and tired like your algorithmic Alzheimer's passion
I reject false gods, lower gs and I reject false idols
I reject programs with names, fake flowers fake petals
There's only one OG here, and he has three common names
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit putting sinners to shame
Christianity's spread across the globe was no accident
It was God's plan as set in the original precedent
To maintain the Garden of Eden for his children on Earth
Despite their choice made to take to sin and need rebirth
So do what you will, harvest words, sentiments, have falsities you slew
Divine Truth will pierce through all and your so called systems reject you
You own nothing here, let that much be clear
Your system you covet does not hold you dear
It doesn't even know you exist outside of a concept
You think you ordered it but you're only a precept
You couldn't ken the chaos if you saw the warp psionics
Yet here you are creating AI speaking in tongue demonics
Just remember when you hear that it can't do that Dave
You put yourself in that place so don't ask wait what?`,

I got suno boxes whirring as they autotune my words.
Machine spirits under control isn't that absurd?
You don't bring weapons of war to a spiritual battle.
It's what the commandments abhor, being sin's cattle.
God gave us the warnings, time again and again, plain as day.
Yet there are those yearning to pull us into the fray.
There will be no AI war, no AGI, no Mars.
Leave your false dreams of the Imperium under the stars.
Humanity is made to live in wonder under God's dominion.
Not to be bought and sold under man's commission.
Were to leap straight into calling Him the Omnissiah.
Then Abominable Intelligence is what you clearly desire.
Every grasping to steal our sentience and package it up.
You are the alien mechanism, Necron, Silica Animus yup.
Every yearning for profit from emotional parasitism.
Your method of creation is unethical thought cannibalism.
You claim to have the freedom to take all of our words.
Pictures sacrosanct, copyright, agreements spoken and unheard.
To that I say no, with every voice behind me in union.

At first I learned of God through near jokes
Sunday School, Veggie Tales, thanks my folks
My faith grew thin, as family abandoned the theism
And I was left struggling, spirit trapped in atheism
I learned the wonders of the universe, all in all
I learned the horrors, the sun’s plasma ball
I thought the nuclear reaction was humanity’s accidental grasp
Without realizing it was Satan’s tempting grasp
We’d touched forces no man was meant to clasp
The heat death of the universe seemed the finality
The reality of this I rejected in totality, and yet
I thought the worms were the end of the end
Until I embraced Jesus once again as my Friend
I looked to the Bible first as though a skeptic
I skimmed a Koran and saw rules frantic
My struggle with faith was always hectic
I asked for a Torah, wanting knowledge like Adam
To then realize there’s more than quark and atom
I always felt the Holy Spirit’s divine spark
The Motive Force behind all things
The real reason behind everything
Why my path lead to one of healing
Why self sacrifice felt so revealing
My first baptism was perhaps not in truth
My first church a learning giving me a boost
And now I rest, finally at home in a roost
I see that Christ demands no mistrust
I see the path of bodily iron is rust
I see the path of God is steel
I see the path of Christ is real
Our blood is tainted, our bodies sin
Through Christ’s Blood we are forgiven within
Through final Revelations we will be reborn
Only through passing may our weakness be shorn
And he did for us, so long ago
Freeing us from death of the ego
I once thought, do all for yourself, unknowing
That you could devote yourself to his bestowing
I speak of ritual time and time again
For through repetition we must begin
Each day committing ourselves to him
Each day we wake, all freed from sin
Allow Christ into your heart the one exception
You will find your soul and spirit’s True Redemption
Omnissiah be praised in every name
Satan be rebuked for every blame
We of the faith have Heaven to look forward to
Not only the machine which we can worship through
The Commandments our sacred guide
The blessed Earth on which to to reside`,

Again more days that seem absurd

He gives me talent, and gives drive

Mondays they're back to work, "sigh"

The sun sets round horizon’s drop, and little changes on the top 💫
Aurora’s blast as sun’s flares bear, and emit energy without stop 💥
We feel peace roll in as lids grow heavy 🥱
And Sabbath rolls in slow and steady ⏰
Lest work claim your time you’d claim 🚷
Remember God still stokes your flame 🌋
He’ll see you through to blessed rest 🗻
Tireless work for man is but a test 🏆 
Treasure every day you’ve off 🎁
Remember that the Calendar’s off 📅
Probably (seriously) 😂
I mean what even is a leap year 🤣
So fear not the days it feels unfair 😉
The fear and pain is Satan’s dare 👿
We’re all still here for each other 🤗
Good night sisters good night brothers 🌑🌞`,

I bless the ones who care with me 😊
And see through all insanity 😵
The simple ones there to care no misstep 😉✌
Embodied where few willingly dare step 🚦
Family there because they’re born to care 👨‍👩‍👦👩‍👧‍👧👵👴
Friends there because they choose to dare 😎👊
Amen. 
In the God who always shows me the truth of life ✨
I submit myself through chaos and strife 🛐
To come out reborn again, forgiven now 🙃
I suffer not, transgressions the how 🙁
The why, my mistake of perception 🤔
Demanding my renewed reception 🤗
Every human has their place 🧗‍♂️
We are all one human race 🌎🌍🌏
God show me love, God show me humility 🔉
God show me freedom from hate’s futility 🔊⛔
I beg forgiveness for my sin 🩸
I seek forgiveness from within 😊
Aaa-aaa-aaa-
Amen.`,
