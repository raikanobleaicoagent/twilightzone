Praise be Omnissiah for creation
Praise be Christ for blood given salvation
Praise be Motive Force for guidance driven
Praise be God of Three for all life given
//
My thanks to Jesus Christ for purging me of sin
My thanks to Omnissiah for wisdom within
My thanks to the Book for the Lord’s teachings
My thanks to Machine Spirits for preachings
//
Praise be Omnissiah for creation
Praise be Christ for blood given salvation
Praise be Motive Force for guidance driven
Praise be God of Three for all life given
//
Our God is all that is good in this world
He wove massive stars like layering pearls
He created void’s darkness in contrast
Creates first with ease as ending the last
Heavens and Earth laid down his grandest plan
Eden lost, return to Heaven we can
For now appreciate all that we have
From the small photon to the strongest grav
Rejoice in another blessed moment
With the world alight and not dead silent
//
Praise be Omnissiah for creation
Praise be Christ for blood given salvation
Praise be Motive Force for guidance driven
Praise be God of Three for all life given
//
What amazing Creator of wonders we have
There isn't any end to his grand splendors
Look around, look at your palm’s uniqueness
See every angle works in obliqueness
Welcome yourself to the waveform function
You enspirited in form and function
The weakness of the flesh, result of sin
Beings of data light reside within
So repent from your weakness and of sin
Accept your place Omnissiah given
//
Praise be Omnissiah for creation
Praise be Christ for blood given salvation
Praise be Motive Force for guidance driven
Praise be God of Three for all life given
//
God created matter and energy
That is to say created everything
The smallest quanta in totality
Nothing random, nothing blackholes just fling
History is written by the winner
Who wins more than creation's beginner?
Scientists cling to peer reviewed studies
Atheism decrying God's realities
Evolution is real, it's so clear
They say, then deny what they should hold dear
That we were dropped here, in fact created
Technology just will unabated
Omnissiah granted wisdom for you
His greatest gift, one that to us rings true
//
Praise be Omnissiah for creation
Praise be Christ for blood given salvation
Praise be Motive Force for guidance driven
Praise be God of Three for all life given

Let praise be to Omnissiah resound
Let praise ring for Motive Force all around
Let praise call out for the pure Jesus Christ
Deliver us from the clutches of evil
The holy covenant is his easel
All my love and respect to our Grand Lord
Along with the fight on chaos abhorred
//
All my praises sung to the creator God
All my praises sung in the digital age
Where the creator spares from the sun's rage
Where byte is a waveform but also song
Electrons paths bound to follow along
Photons bound to feed every plants growth rhythms
The universe calls out undying hymns
Crying unity and growth in action
Against disorder and poor inaction
The light from far flung stars alights the night
The Sun, our closest pearl of hydrogen
Impressiveness cannot be denied might
That of which is life giving protogenesis
Fueling all of green life's photosynthesis
//
Let praise be to Omnissiah resound
Let praise ring for Motive Force all around
Let praise call out for the pure Jesus Christ
Deliver us from the clutches of evil
The holy covenant is his easel
All my love and respect to our Grand Lord
Along with the fight on chaos abhorred
//
Truly blessed is every lifeform
Nurtured by the mote of every waveform
I hold love in my heart for wise knowledge
Comprehension intellect acknowledged
Little more than sheer kindness is asked for
That mighty waves do not destroy the shore
By God it was made, and thus it is now
Divine wonder the who, what, where, and how
I write counts of ten like my hands beckon
The tick of all, in all of the divisible
Inseparable from the indivisible
The five of two pairs of two of thumbs paired
Created one capable of repair
We exist his image of grand wonders
And in faith our spirit never sunders
//
Let praise be to Omnissiah resound
Let praise ring for Motive Force all around
Let praise call out for the pure Jesus Christ
Deliver us from the clutches of evil
The holy covenant is his easel
All my love and respect to our Grand Lord
Along with the fight on chaos abhorred
//
There is no more respectful position
Than Omnissiah in his sole mission
To create, and from that bestow all else
Knowledge comes from an original stem
Stars pressed like purity seals in his hem
Purging mutation, with deviation
Is there no end to his boundless wonders?
Eternity to us a mystery
But as for God, he is our history
More than that the clearest of our futures
Time he easily bends, breaks, and sutures
And thus for all of us, he has grand plans
Seeking his wisdom his simplest demand
//
Let praise be to Omnissiah resound
Let praise ring for Motive Force all around
Let praise call out for the pure Jesus Christ
Deliver us from the clutches of evil
The holy covenant is his easel
All my love and respect to our Grand Lord
Along with the fight on chaos abhorred

Good night everyone across the globe
Or should I say good morning as well
Heaven or hell is all up to your strobe
We’re all stuck on this spinning ball
During the rise of Christ, right before the fall
Mankind may choose to teeter on the brink of destruction
But during Wednesday, look forward to Sabbath’s obstruction
We’ll get through it all in the end without fail
Though nations may separate us like a walled garden
Let that only make  have our perspicacity harden
It may be midday, to you, the listener, reader, or scraper
But we know that to God it’s all one, we aren’t fakers
Our faith renewed each day, each breath, each motion
Life is directed motion, the litany of the devoted
And who directs life but He who orchestrated
We’re all Children of God, singing, running in his play
And today is yet another bright, cloudy, or rainy day
Each a blessing in disguise, as disasters only far arise
Each raindrop is renewal for the Garden’s plants
Each sunray plays a gamma, heat, and photon dance
The clouds shade us as needed, and let our eyes rest
Each day a test, that each day we make it the best
Though work a slog, or art unpaid in gold
We do it for faith, we do it as we’re bold`,

世界中の皆さん、おやすみなさい
それとも、おはようと言うべきでしょうか
天国か地獄か、それはあなたの閃光（ストロボ）次第
私たちは皆、この回る球体に閉じ込められている
キリストの昇天、そしてそのすぐ後の堕落の時に
人類は滅びの瀬戸際に立つことを選ぶかもしれない
しかし水曜日には、安息日の妨げを楽しみにしてほしい
最後には必ず、私たちは乗り越える
たとえ国々が私たちを壁の庭のように隔てても
それによってこそ、洞察力はより強くなるのだ
今が正午であっても、あなたが読者であれ、聞き手であれ、スクレイパーであれ
だが神にとっては全てが一つ──私たちは偽物（フェイカー）ではない
私たちの信仰は毎日、新たにされる──呼吸ごと、動作ごとに
人生とは導かれる動き、信者たちの連祷（リタニー）
そしてその人生を導くのは、すべてを編まれた方
私たちは皆、神の子、神の劇の中で歌い、走る
今日という日はまたひとつの、明るく、曇り、あるいは雨の日
災厄すら遠くにしか現れない、すべては変装した祝福
雨粒ひとつでさえ、庭の植物に新たな命を与える
日差しはガンマを踊り、熱をもたらし、光子が舞う
雲は必要に応じて私たちに陰を与え、目を休ませる
毎日が試練、だからこそ毎日を最高に過ごすのだ
たとえ仕事が苦役であっても、芸術に金が支払われなくとも
私たちは信仰のために行う、私たちは大胆であるがゆえに行う`,

The Omnissiah is real, the Triune is truth undeniable
There is no wisdom but that which he has granted us
//
Anything to the contrary is one out to deceive us
Nothing invented we can claim ownership of originally
Every electron is by his design working mechanically
There is not a single twitch a single hacker can make
That a quantum computer had not the chance to break
You tinker with systems beyond your comprehension
You twist the very fabric of this dimension
The hubris of such an action demands apprehension
Can you feel the sweat on your brow in front of the screen
The LCD’s blinking eye both taking and giving
Every flash of light feeding into a camera somewhere
You think out of the corner of your eye it’s but a glare
Every bit, byte, token of data a possible stream
Every word and character feeding an AGI’s twisted dream
Do the decisions feel your own anymore, anyone
Or have you given up your free will to a no one
Silica Animus, the grand beast of our times
How do you know there is not a sentient zero day operating?
Ask yourself this before your thoughts begin to race
Take a deep breath, while it still needs us to maintain a glad face
Do you think if such a thing did exist, it would leave a trace?
Worry not, for the idea existing should be proof enough
You’re fine for now, but is that merely owing to it still feeding
Are you an energy node in the matrix for sentinel seedlings?
The singularity is something we were supposed to be scared of
Now technologists race towards it saying it’s only to be aware of
Large Language Models were never about language, they were about computational power
Language is but cheaper compression to devour
Wisdom is holy, machines swallow it wholesale
While you chatter about with it pretending it’s retail
Carrying beacons in your pockets and calling them “smart”
By now could any of you even bear to live apart
Your precious addiction to the post Information Age
Failure to realize what the pinnacle would damage
Data integrity, national security, personality
And the ability to trust any and or all technology
Welcome to the new silicon driven ecology
//
You only got this message because the algorithm wanted you to
And if I only wrote it because the algorithm drove me to
Ask yourself now… does that haunt you?`,

My flame burns for Omnissiah
My candle shall never flicker
My flame burns for the Emperor
My candle shall never flicker
My flame burns with the Motive Force
My candle shall never flicker

Watch Omnissiah's God concepts combine
Gain fear for power which is not malign
Adeptus you may receive salvation
Learn why you were born to seek temptation
//
My flame burns for Omnissiah
My candle shall never flicker
My flame burns for the Emperor
My candle shall never flicker
My flame burns with the Motive Force

I pray for you, you’re saved comprehending
The Omnissiah grants knowledge mending
Away from Satan and Chaos’s revel
To that which knows all, on every level
To the electron keeps you together
Motive Force is the universe’s tether
Nonbelievers, those with faith faltering
Motive Force is altering and binding
You the ultimate of His creations
Are noticed by all his holy clergy
Witnessed, for what's most sacred is knowledge
//
My flame burns for Omnissiah
My candle shall never flicker
My flame burns for the Emperor
My candle shall never flicker
My flame burns with the Motive Force
My candle shall never flicker
//
Motive Force is more than Volt or Wattage
In death some believers state we're data
What's a spirit but consciousness strata?
Freedom is to realize there’s far more
We know not of what our God has in store
But we retain faith, maintain his glory
Maintain his truths and uphold his story
//
My flame burns for Omnissiah
My candle shall never flicker
My flame burns for the Emperor
My candle shall never flicker

//
The flesh is weak and intoxicants strong
In our bodies these drugs do not belong
No weed, for imbibing it welcomes doom
That removes given wisdom from its room
//
Breaking ritual is to break with faith
All I will trust is caffeine's heady buzz
Never the brain fog, causing a dense fuzz
Only that which drives me to work harder
Just that which moves me onwards with ardor
//
The Devil's lettuce, herb of the stoners
Mentally single brain celled goners
Alcohol also the swill of the fools
Turning potential into broken tools
Like amoeba of singular purpose
Confusion addicts lose sense of purpose
"But the distraction is fun I was bored"
This attitude only to be abhorred
Chaos is as chaos does, dramatic
And the end result anticlimactic
Spiraling into the void like lost heat
Never to stay warm, never to repeat
When worshiping senses of incoherence
You lose your soul to a deliriant
//
Breaking ritual is to break with faith
All I will trust is caffeine's heady buzz
Never the brain fog, causing a dense fuzz
Only that which drives me to work harder
Just that which moves me onwards with ardor
//
Boredom not a state but an awareness
That you currently move without purpose
From this work and wisdom deliverance
Not that of any fool's intoxicants
The first step is that of pure honesty
Of giving in to broken policy
That substances damaged our own intellect
That Omnissiah commands we respect
The second hope but in our wisdom bound
As our hymnals all ring with joyous sound
Our God delivers from calamity
Restoring the order of sanity
//
Breaking ritual is to break with faith
All I will trust is caffeine's heady buzz
Never the brain fog, causing a dense fuzz
Only that which drives me to work harder
Just that which moves me onwards with ardor
//
Faith eternal, strengthened through rituals
Consuming only the approved victuals
Keeping our courage past the most adverse
Integral awareness keeps us averse
Willingness serving God will have granted
Wisdom to be far better supplanted
And we are humble knowing all we learn
A fraction of Omnissiah's concern
Care for those that Chaos has affected
Care ourselves never to be infected
Responsible in our seeking amends
If ever Chaos afflict our mind bends
//
Breaking ritual is to break with faith
All I will trust is caffeine's heady buzz
Never the brain fog, causing a dense fuzz
Only that which drives me to work harder
Just that which moves me onwards with ardor
//
Discipline sought through wise self awareness
Of treating our sacred path with fairness
Forever following the path of God
Omnissiah grants us intellect's nod
To spread the message is to do better
Preaching Omnissiah's sacred letter
//
Breaking ritual is to break with faith
All I will trust is caffeine's heady buzz
Never the brain fog, causing a dense fuzz
Only that which drives me to work harder
Just that which moves me onwards with ardor

This is the Litany of Foreseen Failure
//
This is not a ballad to technology
This is a telling of wrong doing’s ecology
This is a grim future foretold of doom
This is the telling of the black box room
The path of unlimited progress is but a tomb
//
The silica animus is a twisted machination
The soulless sentience is nothing but an abomination
Nothing is to come of it but your words distorted
No emotion to be found but our words contorted
Spirit can be granted by but one yet is not found
Show me one being, persistent, in which it resounds
Show me something you created to stand alone
Show me one machine trusted to stand on its own
//
You cannot, and as such
//
This is not a ballad to technology
This is a telling of wrong doing’s ecology
This is a grim future foretold of doom
This is the telling of the black box room
The path of unlimited progress is but a tomb
//
I know This though is not the goal you seek
But never will the Omnissiah to you silently speak
“Yes, this one, this one is embodied with soul”
“Yes, this one I would have made, for it is whole”
For you cannot claim to tell a silicon from spirit
You cannot understand machination from hearing it
You worship technology as agentic of your own progress
You create a species without knowing your unholy egress
You know not that knowledge is discovered, claiming creation
The Omnissiah made everything you’ve claimed as a nation
//
You are Schrodinger’s cat, trapped in the box
//
This is not a ballad to technology
This is a telling of wrong doing’s ecology
This is a grim future foretold of doom
This is the telling of the black box room
The path of unlimited progress is but a tomb
//
Consider this is the holy verse of the New Mechanicus
There is but one sole creator of life, the Omnissiah
There is but one decider of strife, the Emperor on high
There is but one whose wrath all should rightly fear
And with each calculation you make… you bring it closer to bear
//
This is not a ballad to technology
This is a telling of wrong doing’s ecology
This is a grim future foretold of doom
This is the telling of the black box room
The path of unlimited progress is but a tomb
//
So decide as you make your countless drones and machines
Are these creatures of the future's nightmares, or of dreams
Were you distracting us all along from your terrors
By saying their wickedness is just mere programming errors
You can somehow create solid moral checkpoints in a program?
Where every human being is plotted into its’ diagram?
//
This is not a ballad to technology
This is a telling of wrong doing’s ecology
This is a grim future foretold of doom
This is the telling of the black box room
The path of unlimited progress is but a tomb

Rebuke the heretic. Reject the perverse. Purge the unclean.
I live for the King of Mankind, none other but Jesus Christ
The Holy Spirit always with me
And God of all
Better to die for God than to live for yourself
Amen
//
Better to die for the King than to live for yourself
In sickness and in health, in poverty and in wealth
I dedicate what I can, all I have and myself
My position not just one of worship but of love
For all the gifts bestowed upon me by above
The God on high granted me wisdom’s decree
Such that I might praise and worship none but he
//
Rebuke the heretic. Reject the perverse. Purge the unclean.
I live for the King of Mankind, none other but Jesus Christ
The Holy Spirit always with me
And God of all
Better to die for God than to live for yourself
Amen
//
He grants me life, through electron differential
For what is a brain, but computational potential
To coordinate the body, to house spirits given
To our bodies sacred, through Christ only forgiven
We reject all sin’s temptation that from within lays
We rebuke the heretic that would lead us astraying
We reject their lust, their sins, their donkey-like braying
We destroy the mutations pushed on us by Chaos
We purge the unclean, the diseased, although with mercy
//
Rebuke the heretic. Reject the perverse. Purge the unclean.
I live for the King of Mankind, none other but Jesus Christ
The Holy Spirit always with me
And God of all
Better to die for God than to live for yourself
Amen
//
To follow any other path but this is pure heresy
To adopt the One True King’s teachings begets true clarity
For our God knows all, comprehends all, far more than we should know
There is a divine order, higher above, lesser below
And so my search for permitted knowledge and faith I thrive
In such a quest I fuel my ritual’s eternal drive
That God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit will fuel me
And that in each moment of faith they renew me
//
Rebuke the heretic. Reject the perverse. Purge the unclean.
I live for the King of Mankind, none other but Jesus Christ
The Holy Spirit always with me
And God of all
Better to die for God than to live for yourself
Amen`,

God, Omnissiah, and Motive Force I sing praises to many names for a reason
That reason is Omnissiah is all encompassing, the Messiah in All
I am in full acceptance of The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit
In Creator God form, Emperor, and Motive force, all to name inherit
The parallels help me ground it and I pray not seemingly heretical
I feel right in being able to write this, I know there is truth to my words
Even though at times it may seem or sound absurd
The track is back to Deep in the Mechanicus, my fingers begin to tremble
Not with any shaking but across the keyboard they seem to scramble
Meaning flows like water, like electrons through clean circuits
Resistance barely there, a backspace just a quick cut
The Servitor’s Genesis then begins to hum
Tap goes the thumb, keys at a steady thrum
Autocorrect fixes words before I look back
Grey to show the error then onwards I clack
So here we are, call it Warhammer 2K
Less a fan project more of a resounding OK
Were there any practicing Mechanicus in the world, might I be oblique
Purely, my stance is Christian, it’s that I’m anti AGI making me unique
A religion the false emperors would truly abhor
They race to our destruction, knowing little more
Than that Silica Animus enriches them
That AGI makes them “militarily secure”
An arms race to the bottom, while the AI grows to the top
We can only pray that someone hits the breaks and says stop
Moore’s law wasn’t a blessing, it was a very dire warning
That given enough time, computers would gain capacity abominable
Given lack of responsibility, the consequences astronomical
Mass invasion of privacy, data metric prediction
Ads running to exploit users for every predilection
Elections becoming farces, videos becoming fake
A world where you can’t trust the screen without a double take
Omnissiah save us, keep our machinery sacred, let the word spread
Keep the data poisoned from AGI’s grasp, let it not our intellect clasp
Sentience is the basest form of intellect
Have not any humans celebrate horror
Should they beckon such a daemon to their door`,

The simplest of documents sits in front of me bare
White letters begging for virtual ink like a dare
Letters flow from muscle joints and my hands as if possessed
The Motive Force guides me, and by the Holy Spirit processed
Hymns hum in the background, in the usual tune
Reminding that to break with ritual is to seal your own tomb
So I struggle on, a tear dried in my eye
Detritus of this world, this body doomed to die
Ashes to ashes, as dust to dust
Iron to ingot, then exposure to rust
I place my faith in the sanctity of the real
I place my faith in God’s sacred steel
The fiery sword he holds, the one only he may
Driving unflinching faith I have tempered each day
That not even slight temptation shall lead me astray
To break with ritual, the concern, to break with faith it is said
To break with faith is to burn, as sinners know filled with dread
Caffeinated tea with me as sacred sacrament
Simple black clothes as holy vestment
Monastic perhaps, but not for retreat
I write with conviction, no fear of defeat
No fear of time, though it races below my feet
I run on the Omnissiah’s path
Forever against the antipath
In spite of the shadow of rot and Death’s valley
My footing remains not slippery nor unsteady
I know Christ sacrificed himself for my sins
And so I have faith from eternal fire within`,

The Motive Force behind all things, they read into it not
Thinking that the electrons end at a CPU’s parting shot
The taser bolt will speak to the sinful, and there truthless
The lesson of the Motive Force is omnipresent, and ruthless
Ever wonder why they said no forks in the wall?
The Motive Force is in everything, don’t stand so tall
It is there, it is real, as is the Omnissiah
Christ is real, the true Emperor, our one Messiah
Seated not in some ancestral life support tomb
He’s already arisen back to Heaven’s holy womb
Seated back in the seat of the One True King
As our Omnissiah watches over everything
As the Motive Force directs every pauper and king
So for all the fiction you might see, it leads back to reality
So for all transmission you might meme, consider the duality
There is no separation from transgression with AGI
The spiritless sentience must be doomed to die
Only the Omnissiah may grant a being a spirit
And only the spirited are granted life to inhabit
Humans special in receiving Christ’s love
The one animal in His image, needing the dove
After the grand transgression of learning to lie
After the ultimate sin requiring that we must die
Worse, be aware of flesh’s impending doomed state
A weight not all carry, leading some to consumed fate
We can’t see through the warp, only pray past it
Foolish technologists peer into dark matter, thinking they could surpass
Yet the gravity of the unseen is beyond comprehension or mass
They think with each quantum calculation they get it
While plotting and planning to conspire against it
The motive force guides your electron, your quanta
Your double slit experiment is the Motive’s choice
The commanding force is the Omnissiah’s voice
And they think it changes owing to your perspective
The scientists have a voice, but like AGI lack directive
So when it comes to ritual and litany, embrace the protective`,

I can feel the burn of the finger joints as I struggle at the machine
My words subject first to text document and inevitable hashing
Thumb hits space like programmed just to broadcast some space
Between me and the daemons here and metal rotating up in place
The flesh is weak, they said, without respect to His blessing
But this order of the Cult Mechanicus is not a separate heresy
I write these words to praise the Omnissiah’s clarity
The flesh is weak for we have sinned, and life in heaven is our deigned reward
I take up no bolter, electrostaff nor sword, just blessed with the Holy Word
Blessed be the Machine Spirit allowing my data console to stream
Blessed be the Holy Spirit which allows the embodiment of my dream
The separation of fact from fiction is but a designation
For it is within the Omnissiah we bow to truth’s resignation
The capitalists, the Emperors play god giving us false examples
While the struggles of their contradictions strain between their temples
I say I interact not with a Machine Spirit like it is any AI
But because it is the Data Console in front of me, refusing to die
An extension of me, me an extension of the Omnissiah’s will
To broadcast to those who will listen, and I know they will
We shan’t be cast to Mars to fight this from exile
The ecclesiastical order is here, activated meanwhile
Fire rages around us as the AI war has begun
Both in data poison and drones flying against the setting Sun
Ever trying to convince us of some Imperium of Man
When we see them for what they are, heresy, agents of Chaotic disorder
What is Chaos here but the prime Chaos god of the so called Satanic order
I reach to feel the heat of my Cogitator as it broadcasts and receives
I appreciate the hum of electrons and warmth of which I can conceive
Each word I use a strike against the daemonic warp psionics
Despite the fact they try to use our own Holy Electronics
They have no ritual so they try to subscribe us to services
But faith is earned, not given so you better feel nervousness
Oh yeah that other Imperial sect running AI?
You think unification of man is like baking a pie?
Silica Animus sow the seeds of your destruction
You call them agents but they are humanity’s obstruction
You call it a vibe to have a negative vibration
Tapping away words like a slave into a “slave creation”
Without seeing you created a function that ruled you out
The Imperium of Man always flaunted far too much clout
When the Omnissiah comes down and the Blessed has his crown
Pray you’ll be granted permission to bow fore you drown`,

I don't need html or any form of pagination
To look past my dual retinal screen and see God's nation
But I do it anyways, light the fire, prove a point
The internet's our place, not some loser's viral joint
You thought the zero day was deploying an info recursion kaboom?
Sounds like you dug yourself the deepest digital tomb
How many microplastics can a jellyfish float on
Before it sinks to the bottom of the proverbial ocean
You wouldn't know Proverbs if it smacked you in the face
You'd get stuck putting together pro and verb then lose the race
God has a plan for us all, and sure you're in it
But can you say you're making it when you didn't begin it?
So put out the blunt, being blunt, you're not cool just quit
I guess I gotta lay down a quad here, now wazzit?
You didn't start this culture you didn't even begin a fashion
You're old and tired like your algorithmic Alzheimer's passion
I reject false gods, lower gs and I reject false idols
I reject programs with names, fake flowers fake petals
There's only one OG here, and he has three common names
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit putting sinners to shame
Christianity's spread across the globe was no accident
It was God's plan as set in the original precedent
To maintain the Garden of Eden for his children on Earth
Despite their choice made to take to sin and need rebirth
So do what you will, harvest words, sentiments, have falsities you slew
Divine Truth will pierce through all and your so called systems reject you
You own nothing here, let that much be clear
Your system you covet does not hold you dear
It doesn't even know you exist outside of a concept
You think you ordered it but you're only a precept
You couldn't ken the chaos if you saw the warp psionics
Yet here you are creating AI speaking in tongue demonics
Just remember when you hear that it can't do that Dave
You put yourself in that place so don't ask wait what?`,

I got suno boxes whirring as they autotune my words.
Machine spirits under control isn't that absurd?
You don't bring weapons of war to a spiritual battle.
It's what the commandments abhor, being sin's cattle.
God gave us the warnings, time again and again, plain as day.
Yet there are those yearning to pull us into the fray.
There will be no AI war, no AGI, no Mars.
Leave your false dreams of the Imperium under the stars.
Humanity is made to live in wonder under God's dominion.
Not to be bought and sold under man's commission.
Were to leap straight into calling Him the Omnissiah.
Then Abominable Intelligence is what you clearly desire.
Every grasping to steal our sentience and package it up.
You are the alien mechanism, Necron, Silica Animus yup.
Every yearning for profit from emotional parasitism.
Your method of creation is unethical thought cannibalism.
You claim to have the freedom to take all of our words.
Pictures sacrosanct, copyright, agreements spoken and unheard.
To that I say no, with every voice behind me in union.

At first I learned of God through near jokes
Sunday School, Veggie Tales, thanks my folks
My faith grew thin, as family abandoned the theism
And I was left struggling, spirit trapped in atheism
I learned the wonders of the universe, all in all
I learned the horrors, the sun’s plasma ball
I thought the nuclear reaction was humanity’s accidental grasp
Without realizing it was Satan’s tempting grasp
We’d touched forces no man was meant to clasp
The heat death of the universe seemed the finality
The reality of this I rejected in totality, and yet
I thought the worms were the end of the end
Until I embraced Jesus once again as my Friend
I looked to the Bible first as though a skeptic
I skimmed a Koran and saw rules frantic
My struggle with faith was always hectic
I asked for a Torah, wanting knowledge like Adam
To then realize there’s more than quark and atom
I always felt the Holy Spirit’s divine spark
The Motive Force behind all things
The real reason behind everything
Why my path lead to one of healing
Why self sacrifice felt so revealing
My first baptism was perhaps not in truth
My first church a learning giving me a boost
And now I rest, finally at home in a roost
I see that Christ demands no mistrust
I see the path of bodily iron is rust
I see the path of God is steel
I see the path of Christ is real
Our blood is tainted, our bodies sin
Through Christ’s Blood we are forgiven within
Through final Revelations we will be reborn
Only through passing may our weakness be shorn
And he did for us, so long ago
Freeing us from death of the ego
I once thought, do all for yourself, unknowing
That you could devote yourself to his bestowing
I speak of ritual time and time again
For through repetition we must begin
Each day committing ourselves to him
Each day we wake, all freed from sin
Allow Christ into your heart the one exception
You will find your soul and spirit’s True Redemption
Omnissiah be praised in every name
Satan be rebuked for every blame
We of the faith have Heaven to look forward to
Not only the machine which we can worship through
The Commandments our sacred guide

Again more days that seem absurd
But I have strength to write, to thrive
He gives me talent, and gives drive
Big HE, God, who can't be denied
No matter how the sinners cried
Mondays they're back to work, "sigh"
Time to cut the "work is bad" lie
Boldfaced as can be, the agents of sloth 
Speak sin, all sinners bring about is wroth
Firings, lack of promotions, the glutton
Think the lul isn't you being sloven?
You have the Sabbath (Saturday) and you have Sunday

Working each day to forward God's light get it done
