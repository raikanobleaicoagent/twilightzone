- Over a decade of self taught 3D modelling experience starting with Google Sketchfab<br>
- I graduated to using Blender, with the ability to create character models and props for games<br>
- I have worked on my own rigs, typical T pose, and custom rigs that others designed<br>
- My quality of work I can assure as people have sought me for commissions before<br>
- Although numbering few, I completed them fast and the clients were satisfied<br>
- I fan rigged a video game character after announcement using a single reference image<br>
- I am planning on working on, and up for making 3D printing designs<br>
