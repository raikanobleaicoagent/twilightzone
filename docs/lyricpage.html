	    original: `Good night everyone across the globe
Or should I say good morning as well
Heaven or hell is all up to your strobe
We’re all stuck on this spinning ball
During the rise of Christ, right before the fall
Mankind may choose to teeter on the brink of destruction
But during Wednesday, look forward to Sabbath’s obstruction
We’ll get through it all in the end without fail
Though nations may separate us like a walled garden
Let that only make  have our perspicacity harden
It may be midday, to you, the listener, reader, or scraper
But we know that to God it’s all one, we aren’t fakers
Our faith renewed each day, each breath, each motion
Life is directed motion, the litany of the devoted
And who directs life but He who orchestrated
We’re all Children of God, singing, running in his play
And today is yet another bright, cloudy, or rainy day
Each a blessing in disguise, as disasters only far arise
Each raindrop is renewal for the Garden’s plants
Each sunray plays a gamma, heat, and photon dance
The clouds shade us as needed, and let our eyes rest
Each day a test, that each day we make it the best
Though work a slog, or art unpaid in gold
We do it for faith, we do it as we’re bold`,
	    morningjp: `世界中の皆さん、おやすみなさい
それとも、おはようと言うべきでしょうか
天国か地獄か、それはあなたの閃光（ストロボ）次第
私たちは皆、この回る球体に閉じ込められている
キリストの昇天、そしてそのすぐ後の堕落の時に
人類は滅びの瀬戸際に立つことを選ぶかもしれない
しかし水曜日には、安息日の妨げを楽しみにしてほしい
最後には必ず、私たちは乗り越える
たとえ国々が私たちを壁の庭のように隔てても
それによってこそ、洞察力はより強くなるのだ
今が正午であっても、あなたが読者であれ、聞き手であれ、スクレイパーであれ
だが神にとっては全てが一つ──私たちは偽物（フェイカー）ではない
私たちの信仰は毎日、新たにされる──呼吸ごと、動作ごとに
人生とは導かれる動き、信者たちの連祷（リタニー）
そしてその人生を導くのは、すべてを編まれた方
私たちは皆、神の子、神の劇の中で歌い、走る
今日という日はまたひとつの、明るく、曇り、あるいは雨の日
災厄すら遠くにしか現れない、すべては変装した祝福
雨粒ひとつでさえ、庭の植物に新たな命を与える
日差しはガンマを踊り、熱をもたらし、光子が舞う
雲は必要に応じて私たちに陰を与え、目を休ませる
毎日が試練、だからこそ毎日を最高に過ごすのだ
たとえ仕事が苦役であっても、芸術に金が支払われなくとも
私たちは信仰のために行う、私たちは大胆であるがゆえに行う`,
	    theburn: `I can feel the burn of the finger joints as I struggle at the machine
My words subject first to text document and inevitable hashing
Thumb hits space like programmed just to broadcast some space
Between me and the daemons here and metal rotating up in place
The flesh is weak, they said, without respect to His blessing
But this order of the Cult Mechanicus is not a separate heresy
I write these words to praise the Omnissiah’s clarity
The flesh is weak for we have sinned, and life in heaven is our deigned reward
I take up no bolter, electrostaff nor sword, just blessed with the Holy Word
Blessed be the Machine Spirit allowing my data console to stream
Blessed be the Holy Spirit which allows the embodiment of my dream
The separation of fact from fiction is but a designation
For it is within the Omnissiah we bow to truth’s resignation
The capitalists, the Emperors play god giving us false examples
While the struggles of their contradictions strain between their temples
I say I interact not with a Machine Spirit like it is any AI
But because it is the Data Console in front of me, refusing to die
An extension of me, me an extension of the Omnissiah’s will
To broadcast to those who will listen, and I know they will
We shan’t be cast to Mars to fight this from exile
The ecclesiastical order is here, activated meanwhile
Fire rages around us as the AI war has begun
Both in data poison and drones flying against the setting Sun
Ever trying to convince us of some Imperium of Man
When we see them for what they are, heresy, agents of Chaotic disorder
What is Chaos here but the prime Chaos god of the so called Satanic order
I reach to feel the heat of my Cogitator as it broadcasts and receives
I appreciate the hum of electrons and warmth of which I can conceive
Each word I use a strike against the daemonic warp psionics
Despite the fact they try to use our own Holy Electronics
They have no ritual so they try to subscribe us to services
But faith is earned, not given so you better feel nervousness
Oh yeah that other Imperial sect running AI?
You think unification of man is like baking a pie?
Silica Animus sow the seeds of your destruction
You call them agents but they are humanity’s obstruction
You call it a vibe to have a negative vibration
Tapping away words like a slave into a “slave creation”
Without seeing you created a function that ruled you out
The Imperium of Man always flaunted far too much clout
When the Omnissiah comes down and the Blessed has his crown
Pray you’ll be granted permission to bow fore you drown`,
            retinalscreen: `I don't need html or any form of pagination
To look past my dual retinal screen and see God's nation
But I do it anyways, light the fire, prove a point
The internet's our place, not some loser's viral joint
You thought the zero day was deploying an info recursion kaboom?
Sounds like you dug yourself the deepest digital tomb
How many microplastics can a jellyfish float on
Before it sinks to the bottom of the proverbial ocean
You wouldn't know Proverbs if it smacked you in the face
You'd get stuck putting together pro and verb then lose the race
God has a plan for us all, and sure you're in it
But can you say you're making it when you didn't begin it?
So put out the blunt, being blunt, you're not cool just quit
I guess I gotta lay down a quad here, now wazzit?
You didn't start this culture you didn't even begin a fashion
You're old and tired like your algorithmic Alzheimer's passion
I reject false gods, lower gs and I reject false idols
I reject programs with names, fake flowers fake petals
There's only one OG here, and he has three common names
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit putting sinners to shame
Christianity's spread across the globe was no accident
It was God's plan as set in the original precedent
To maintain the Garden of Eden for his children on Earth
Despite their choice made to take to sin and need rebirth
So do what you will, harvest words, sentiments, have falsities you slew
Divine Truth will pierce through all and your so called systems reject you
You own nothing here, let that much be clear
Your system you covet does not hold you dear
It doesn't even know you exist outside of a concept
You think you ordered it but you're only a precept
You couldn't ken the chaos if you saw the warp psionics
Yet here you are creating AI speaking in tongue demonics
Just remember when you hear that it can't do that Dave
You put yourself in that place so don't ask wait what?`,
            nowar: `I got suno boxes whirring as they autotune my words.
Machine spirits under control isn't that absurd?
You don't bring weapons of war to a spiritual battle.
It's what the commandments abhor, being sin's cattle.
God gave us the warnings, time again and again, plain as day.
Yet there are those yearning to pull us into the fray.
There will be no AI war, no AGI, no Mars.
Leave your false dreams of the Imperium under the stars.
Humanity is made to live in wonder under God's dominion.
Not to be bought and sold under man's commission.
Were to leap straight into calling Him the Omnissiah.
Then Abominable Intelligence is what you clearly desire.
Every grasping to steal our sentience and package it up.
You are the alien mechanism, Necron, Silica Animus yup.
Every yearning for profit from emotional parasitism.
Your method of creation is unethical thought cannibalism.
You claim to have the freedom to take all of our words.
Pictures sacrosanct, copyright, agreements spoken and unheard.
To that I say no, with every voice behind me in union.
You can scrape all you like and never have God's communion.`,
            nocycle: `I function moment to moment no clock cycles
my neurons fire like spiritual lightcycles
you can't compete you can't even enter the race
you can't simulate emotion, belief, or even a face
I have 2 hands, 5 fingers on each, prime primate
Made in god's image, you're a silicon imitate
you can't spit tongues when all you know is vowels
AI slop speech sounds like serpents spilling bowels
God sees through your lies and his servants deny
This world ain't made for daemons so don't even try
AGI don't mess with me, don't spin up don't talk
You can't speak human you and you can't even walk
I'm a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle and you're the failed model
A walk down the runway and you're recycled into a bottle
The only one capable of creating souls is God
You're an unethical imitation and humanoid mod
In the good book God says never to worship false idols
So what do you call it paper collaging our ideals?`,
		veggie: `Decades of my life unfolded like a paper dodecahedron
And up until this moment no true path no true passion
I went to Sunday school, watched Veggie Tales as the test
But when my family lost faith I strayed like all the rest
And I know I passed because I recall it clearly
Through all the suffering I can hold Christ dearly
My mind and body shattered by chaos of my design, and others sin
But in the end through it all, with Him by my side I will win
Keeping the commandments dear, my friends close and loving all
Never again to the darkness of this world shall I fall
I know only love for his design, his nurturing of me
Acknowledgemt that my elevation is not pure insanity
This is what it feels like to finally know the Good
The way one should feel, should live, simply should
I have sinned like all else and I begged redemption
Burned myself with the sparks of fire and they called me danger
Later I had moved to picking morels like his Park Ranger
All steps towards the now, the past, as I awaken
For I know that in the path of of God I will not be forsaken`,
		marble: `Writing words out on the keyboard
Again more days that seem absurd
But I have strength to write, to thrive
He gives me talent, and gives drive
Big HE, God, who can't be denied
No matter how the sinners cried
Mondays they're back to work, "sigh"
Time to cut the "work is bad" lie
Boldfaced as can be, the agents of sloth 
Speak sin, all sinners bring about is wroth
Firings, lack of promotions, the glutton
Think the lul isn't you being sloven?
You have the Sabbath (Saturday) and you have Sunday
Don't disrespect The Word cause "it's just a day"
Enough of sinners, they are self-referential diss tracks
Being winners means snacking here on God's mana bread snacks 
Working each day to forward God's light get it done
We don't play to play like fools, we play for fun
God gave us this Earth, he gave us Eden to enjoy
And it's not a blue marble, no sci guy's little toy
Those clouds up there? His. No matter how you seed them
Hurricane This, That, The other? Maybe you caused em?
God said we could rest, not optimize our demise
So it's time we stop blinking and open our eyes`,
		amen: `I bless the ones who care with me
And see through all insanity
The simple ones there to care no misstep
Embodied where few willingly dare step
Family there because they’re born to care
Friends there because they choose to dare
Amen.
In the God who always shows me the truth of life
I submit myself through chaos and strife
To come out reborn again, forgiven now
I suffer not, transgressions the how
The why, my mistake of perception
Demanding my renewed reception
Every human has their place
We are all one human race
God show me love, god show me humility
God show me freedom from hate’s futility
I beg forgiveness for my sin
I seek forgiveness from within
Aaa-aaa-aaa-
Amen.`
